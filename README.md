The Ferriludium repository is a group for several planned project-level repositories.

Currently there are only two:

* [FeCache](https://bitbucket.org/ccperkins/fecache), an extremely lightweight (*) simple caching system in Java which allows entries to be cached with different expiration times;
* [FeSimpleGeoProx](https://bitbucket.org/ccperkins/fesimplegeoprox), a lightweight collection of user-supplied geographical points which supports fast proximity search by search within a radius or by rectangle.
